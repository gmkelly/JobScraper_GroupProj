# JobScraper_GropProj

Scraper project that combines job data on national and state level to analyze it.
  State data is from https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oessrcst.htm
  National data is from https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm

Run Scraper1 first, then run Scraper2.
Then run Team 4 Analysis to see some basic information that can be found from combining the CSV's.

All code written by my group members and I for an ISDS 3200 class at LSU taught by Vikram Sadhya.
Code updated and edited by me for upload to GitHub.
